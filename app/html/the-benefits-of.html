                <h2>Indoor Navigation</h2>
                <p>
                    You are at an airport and you are not sure where to drop your bags or which gate your flight departs
                    from. Beacons can navigate you via the airport app.
                </p>


                <h2>Efficient Service and Quick Payments</h2>
                <p>
                    Many times you need to buy something in a rush but the service is slow and you walk away. No more.
                    Beacons allow staff members to work fast and
                    efficiently.
                </p>

                <h2>Reduced Waiting Time and Queuing</h2>
                <p>
                    You want to grab a coffee on your way to work but you want to avoid queuing. Order online on your
                    smartphone whilst approaching the coffee house.
                </p>

                <h2>Proximity Marketing</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most attractive part of Beacon technology. It creates a constant and locally responsive
                    billboard right in the palm of your memberâ€™s hands. Say your member is walking past your juice
                    bar... they can receive an instant coupon or other incentive in order to drive a purchase. This can
                    be applied to all other areas of your club such as PT, merchandise, and fitness classes. The message
                    would appear on your Club Mobile App.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Personalized Messaging
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By interacting with your CRM, the beacon can use information about members to tailor messages to
                    them. If a members has frequented spin classes in the past, the beacon can send a push notification
                    prompting them to sign up for more classes the next time they walk past the spin studio. Similar to
                    today, signing up for the class would be done seamlessly from your Club Mobile App on members'
                    smartphones.
